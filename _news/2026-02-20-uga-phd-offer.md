I am thrilled to announce that I have received a PhD offer in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.uga.edu/" target="_blank">University of Georgia</a>! I will be starting my doctoral studies at UGA in Fall 2026. I am deeply grateful to all the professors and teachers who supported me throughout the application process.
